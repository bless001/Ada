# Agent Platform Architecture

This document describes the modular agent-platform foundation added on top of the existing `planning_agent_core` package. The design is additive: existing FastAPI routes, services, skills, repository analysis, OpenProject, Neo4j, Weaviate, and coding-attempt behavior remain in place while new agents depend on stable platform contracts.

## Current Architecture Summary

The repository currently has a working planning-oriented application with these reusable pieces:

- `planning_agent_core/skills/` contains modular planning skills for ingestion, requirement extraction, ambiguity assessment, decomposition, validation, repository inspection, OpenProject projection, Neo4j projection, Weaviate projection, and context capsules.
- `planning_agent_core/services/` contains application services for planning sessions, documents, context capsules, repository analysis, repository projection, and coding attempts.
- `planning_agent_core/ports/` already defines infrastructure ports for project repositories, events, approvals, artifacts, OpenProject, graph storage, vector storage, repository filesystem, repository analysis, command execution, LLM generation, and coding attempts.
- `planning_agent_core/adapters/` contains concrete adapters for OpenProject, Neo4j, Weaviate, repository filesystem, command execution, Tree-sitter extraction, LSP lookup, and repository analysis.
- `planning_agent_core/workflow/` contains the existing planning LangGraph workflow and remains a compatibility path.

The new platform package does not replace those pieces. It wraps and organizes them behind agent lifecycle contracts and dependency injection.

## Target Package Boundary

The platform root is `planning_agent_core/agent_platform/`.

```text
agent_platform/
  agents/
    base/
    planning/
    coding/
    verification/
  factory/
  orchestration/
  runtime/
  adapters/
    llm/
    postgres/
    neo4j/
    weaviate/
    openproject/
    git/
    filesystem/
    command_runner/
  config/
```

Important boundary rules:

- Agents depend on `agents/base`, `runtime`, typed request/result models, skills, and injected dependencies.
- Agents do not import concrete database, OpenProject, Neo4j, Weaviate, Git, filesystem, command-runner, or LLM clients directly.
- The orchestrator depends on common contracts and the factory, not on agent-specific business logic.
- Agent modules own their request/result/state/workflow definitions.
- Skills remain reusable units and do not depend on whole agent objects.

Application code can use `planning_agent_core/services/agent_platform_service.py` as the migration entry point for invoking the platform without directly constructing the factory and orchestrator.

FastAPI exposes the platform through `POST /v1/agents/execute`. The route accepts a typed discriminated union of Planning, Coding, and Verification requests, creates request-scoped durable stores, and invokes `AgentPlatformService`.

OpenProject event orchestration uses the same service for resumable planning events. `ProjectEventOrchestrator` builds a typed `PlanningAgentRequest` from the persisted event and waiting planning session, then invokes the platform orchestrator instead of directly calling the planning workflow runner when `agent_platform_service` is configured.

## Common Agent Lifecycle

All concrete agents implement `BaseAgent`:

```python
class BaseAgent(ABC):
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def agent_type(self) -> str: ...

    @abstractmethod
    async def initialize(self) -> None: ...

    @abstractmethod
    async def validate_request(self, request: AgentRequest) -> None: ...

    @abstractmethod
    async def execute(self, request: AgentRequest, context: AgentExecutionContext) -> AgentResult: ...

    @abstractmethod
    async def shutdown(self) -> None: ...
```

The lifecycle helper runs `initialize`, `validate_request`, `execute`, and `shutdown` consistently.

## Shared Contracts

Cross-agent communication uses typed Pydantic models:

- `AgentRequest`
- `AgentResult`
- `ArtifactReference`
- `StateReference`
- `AgentError`
- `AgentExecutionContext`
- `CheckpointIdentity`
- `AgentLifecycleEvent`

Specialized agents extend the base contracts:

- `PlanningAgentRequest` and `PlanningAgentResult`
- `CodingAgentRequest` and `CodingAgentResult`
- `VerificationAgentRequest` and `VerificationAgentResult`

The orchestrator accepts `AgentExecutionRequest` and returns `AgentOrchestrationResult`. It preserves specialized subclass payloads using Pydantic `SerializeAsAny` while still enforcing the common base contract.

## Agent Responsibilities

Planning Agent:

- Extracts requirements from the objective and provided document chunks.
- Optionally wraps the existing planning service for session-based plan drafting.
- Validates provided or generated plans using `PlanValidationSkill`.
- Returns approval, clarification, or coding transitions through `next_action`.
- Saves independent planning state through the checkpoint store.

Coding Agent:

- Requires an approved task-scoped `CodingAttemptRequest`.
- Delegates bounded implementation execution to the injected coding service.
- Records changed files, command evidence, errors, final diff, and rollback data.
- Returns verification, retry, or escalation transitions.
- Does not redefine requirements or expand task scope.

Verification Agent:

- Loads the original acceptance criteria and coding result or diff.
- Evaluates the actual diff, command evidence, and coding status independently from the coding summary.
- Produces one of `passed`, `passed_with_warnings`, `changes_requested`, or `blocked`.
- Returns completion, coding rework, or escalation transitions.

## Factory And Registration

Agent creation is registry-based. `AgentFactory` has no large conditional block.

```python
factory = create_default_agent_factory(dependencies)
agent = factory.create(
    agent_type="planning",
    config=config.agents["planning"],
)
```

Default registration is implemented by each agent module exposing a `register_*_agent` function. The default factory calls those registration functions.

Adding a new agent requires:

1. Implementing `BaseAgent`.
2. Adding request, result, state, workflow, and config models.
3. Adding an `AgentBuilder`.
4. Registering the builder.

Example fourth agent:

```python
class SecurityReviewAgentBuilder:
    @property
    def agent_type(self) -> str:
        return "security_review"

    def build(self, *, config: AgentConfig, dependencies: AgentDependencyContainer) -> BaseAgent:
        return SecurityReviewAgent(config=config, dependencies=dependencies)

factory.register(
    "security_review",
    SecurityReviewAgentBuilder(),
)

agent = factory.create(
    agent_type="security_review",
    config=config.agents["security_review"],
)
```

No orchestrator changes are required.

## Orchestration

`AgentOrchestrator` is intentionally lightweight. It performs platform coordination only:

- Creates an `AgentExecutionContext`.
- Uses the factory to create the requested agent.
- Emits lifecycle events.
- Runs the common lifecycle helper.
- Persists the result through an injected result store.
- Converts exceptions into structured failed `AgentResult` objects and preserves a checkpoint entry.
- Computes a high-level route from `AgentNextAction`.

Agents never call each other directly. The orchestrator maps next actions to route decisions:

- `run_planning` routes to Planning Agent.
- `run_coding` routes to Coding Agent.
- `run_verification` routes to Verification Agent.
- `request_approval` pauses for an approval gate.
- `request_clarification` or `escalate` pauses for human intervention.
- `complete` ends the flow.

## State And Checkpointing

State is separated into three layers:

- Agent workflow state: agent-specific Pydantic state models.
- Cross-agent metadata: `AgentExecutionContext`, lifecycle events, and persisted results.
- Long-term project memory: existing domain stores, artifacts, OpenProject, Neo4j, and Weaviate.

Checkpoint identity includes:

- `project_id`
- `workflow_id`
- `agent_type`
- `agent_instance_id`
- `execution_id`
- `thread_id`
- `checkpoint_id`

The current implementation includes `InMemoryCheckpointStore` for tests and local contract validation. `SqlAlchemyAgentCheckpointStore` persists platform checkpoints in `agent_platform_checkpoints`.

Agent results can be stored through `SqlAlchemyAgentResultStore`, which writes typed result payloads to `agent_platform_results`. The orchestrator uses `dependencies.result_store` when no explicit result store is supplied.

PostgreSQL-backed LangGraph checkpointing remains available in the existing workflow package for internal LangGraph workflows and can be used inside each agent where needed.

## Adapters And Dependency Injection

`AgentDependencyContainer` provides shared infrastructure to agents through constructor injection and execution context. It defaults to in-memory checkpoint and event-bus implementations for tests.

Platform adapter namespaces expose interfaces for:

- `LLMClient`
- `ExecutionRepository`
- `ArtifactRepository`
- `ApprovalRepository`
- `ProjectRepository`
- `CodingAttemptRepository`
- `GraphRepository`
- `SemanticContextStore`
- `WorkPackageGateway`
- `GitRepository`
- `RepositoryBindingStore`
- `RepositoryAnalysisGateway`
- `SyntaxExtractionGateway`
- `LspLookupGateway`
- `FilesystemWorkspace`
- `CommandRunner`

Most are aliases over existing `planning_agent_core.ports` protocols, so concrete adapters do not need to move immediately.

## Configuration

The platform configuration is represented by:

- `AgentConfig`
- `AgentPlatformConfig`
- `LLMEndpointConfig`

The loader accepts JSON and returns a deep copy of the default config when no path is provided. Example configuration is in `planning_agent_core/agent-platform.example.json`.

The LLM endpoint remains configurable by:

- `base_url`
- `model`
- `timeout_seconds`
- `context_window`

No llama.cpp endpoint is hard-coded.

## Observability

The platform emits structured lifecycle events:

- `agent.created`
- `agent.started`
- `agent.step.started`
- `agent.step.completed`
- `agent.interrupted`
- `agent.failed`
- `agent.completed`
- `agent.result.persisted`
- `agent.transition.requested`

Every event includes execution, project, task, agent, instance, timestamp, status, step, and correlation fields. The default test implementation stores events in memory. A structured logging event bus writes JSON records.

## Testing Strategy

The new platform test suite covers:

- Registered agents implement `BaseAgent`.
- Factory registration, duplicate registration, unknown agent type, disabled config, and builder mismatch handling.
- Valid request acceptance and invalid request rejection.
- Result contract validation for planning, coding, and verification.
- Orchestration transitions for planning approval, coding to verification, verification rework, verification blocked, planning clarification, and coding blocked.
- Checkpoint namespace isolation and failure checkpoint preservation.

The tests use fake dependencies and do not require Docker, OpenProject, Neo4j, Weaviate, or a live LLM.
